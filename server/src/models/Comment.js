/**
 * Comment
 *
 * Attaches to either an Issue or a Knowledge article via the `refType`
 * discriminator — a shared primitive, not a per-target collection.
 *
 * Schema-enforceable constraints (this file):
 * - required fields, type correctness
 * - `refType` enum membership
 * - compound index on (refType, refId) for the one established access
 *   pattern (listing a target's comments)
 *
 * NOT enforced here (service layer, per persistence-design.md §3 and §6):
 * - one-level nesting: "a `parentComment` may reference only a top-level
 *   Comment; a Comment whose own `parentComment` is non-null cannot be
 *   used as a parent." This requires loading the referenced parent
 *   Comment and inspecting its own `parentComment` field at write time —
 *   a cross-document, contextual check, not something Mongoose can
 *   validate from this document's own fields. No recursive/depth
 *   validator is implemented here; deliberately left to the service
 *   layer's `createComment`/`replyToComment` operation.
 * - that `refId` actually points to an existing Issue or Knowledge
 *   document of the type named by `refType` (refId is intentionally
 *   untyped/polymorphic — no `ref` option is set, since it can't point
 *   to one fixed collection)
 *
 * No `parentComment` index is created — no established access pattern
 * queries by parentComment directly (see persistence-design.md §6); all
 * currently planned reads go through the (refType, refId) index and
 * group replies in the response layer.
