 * getSnapshot split expresses "different value on server vs. client"

 * - Server renders with resolvedTheme === undefined
 * - Client renders with "dark" or "light"
 * - React flags a hydration mismatch and either logs an error or
 *   silently produces the wrong UI on first paint
 *
 * The guard renders a visually identical placeholder (same size,
 * same variant) until the client has mounted and next-themes has
 * resolved the stored preference. This avoids both the hydration
 * error and a visible layout shift when the icon appears.
